                <h3>Easily build and grow your clusters</h3>
                <p>
                    With just a few clicks, you can set up Docker clusters and decide how many containers you need to run. Whether you're starting small or handling heavy traffic, you can easily scale up or down based on your needs. Each cluster gets a unique name and ID, so managing them is super simple and clear.

                <h3>Manage cluster Nodes</h3>
                <p>
                    Have total control over each container in your cluster. You can add new containers, view details, update them, or remove the ones you don’t need—all without disrupting the entire cluster. It’s like having the power to fine-tune your cluster one container at a time.

                <h3>Take snapshots and roll back with ease</h3>
                <p>
                    You can save the state of any container or even an entire cluster by creating a snapshot (a Docker image). If something goes wrong, you can quickly roll back to a previous saved state. It’s a reliable way to ensure your work is never lost and your clusters stay stable.

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project was inspired by my passion for making complex tasks more manageable. As a developer, I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can simplify large-scale operations, like managing containers across multiple servers. I realized the need for an easy-to-use platform that could streamline the process of deploying and scaling Docker clusters. This led me to develop a tool that would make cluster management accessible, even for teams without deep DevOps experience.
            It has been an exciting challenge developing this as part of my portfolio for Holberton School. Every step of the process has allowed me to grow as a developer, pushing me to build something that combines ease of use with powerful capabilities. I’m proud of what I’ve created and eager to continue improving it!
